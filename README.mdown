Archimulator in a Glance
------------------

Archimulator is an easy-to-use, feature-rich, and extensible CMP architectural simulator powered by Java on 32/64 bit Linux/Unix..

Web Site
------------------

Please obtain the latest Archimulator code from Archimulator on Github: http://github.com/mcai/Archimulator/.

Key Features
------------------

- Archimulator is written in 100% Java with the aid of JNA (Java Native Access) for native POSIX syscall implementations,
  which assures its portability and usability across many Linux machine configurations.

- Archimulator facilitates interface-based hierarchical object orientation to improve code readability and extensibility.

- Archimulator provides **functional architectural simulation** of:
	- Program loading for statically-linked MIPS32 ELF executables (both Little Endian and Big Endian are supported);
	- Functional execution of common integer and floating-point instructions of MIPS32 ISA;
	- Emulation of common POSIX system calls;
	- Execution of Pthreads based multithreaded programs.

- Archimulator provides **cycle-accurate microarchitectural simulation** of:
	- Separate pipeline structures such as the reorder buffer, separate integer and floating point physical register files;
	- Explicit register renaming based on the merged architectural and rename register file model;
	- Single-threaded superscalar out-of-order execution, multithreaded SMT and CMP execution model;
	- Multi-level inclusive cache hierarchy with the directory-based MESI coherence protocol;
	- Simple cycle-accurate DRAM controller model;
	- Various kinds of static and dynamic branch predictors, checkpointing-based pipeline recovery on branch misprediction.

- Archimulator supports the following **unclassified simulation features**:
	- Support measurement of instructions, pipeline structures and the memory hierarchy;
	- Support generation of instruction traces;
	- Support both execution-driven and trace-driven memory subsystem simulation;
	- Support complex simulation strategies, e.g., cycle count based, instruction count based, and hotspot oriented simulation;
	- Support seamless switching between functional simulation and performance simulation mode;
	- Support the helper thread based data prefetching scheme: classification of good, bad and ugly prefetch requests.

- Archimulator provides the following **common infrastructure**:
	- Scheduling and dispatching framework for modeling synchronous (cycle accurate) and asynchronous activities;
	- Database/ORM supported configuration and statistics reporting of the simulated architectures, workloads and simulations;
	- An easy-to-use logging mechanism.

- Archimulator currently supports correct execution of all the **Olden benchmark suite** except incorrect output from "health", plus some of CPU2006 benchmarks. Other benchmarks are being tested.

System Requirements
------------------

Archimulator has been tested on 64 bit **Ubuntu Linux 12.04** on an Intel Core i7 machine with 32 GB memory.

For **developing and running Archimulator**, make sure that:

1. You have Ubuntu Linux 12.04 or higher (or other mainstream Linux distros);

2. To compile and run Java programs, the following software must be installed:
	- Open JDK 8.0 or higher;
	- Apache Maven 3.0.4 or higher.

Quick Start
------------------

0. For Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distros (other distros can be similarly prepared):
	- sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib git-core

1. git clone git://github.com/mcai/Archimulator.git;
cd Archimulator;
mvn clean install

2. chmod +x ./archimulator.sh;./archimulator.sh

Customizing Archimulator for Your Needs
------------------

- Archimulator has shipped a few benchmark binaries under the directory: `benchmarks/` for your convenience.
So if you use Archimulator for testing purposes only, there is no need to compile benchmarks for Archimulator by yourself.

- As is always true for open source software, the existing Archimulator code are good examples for demonstrating its usage and power.
